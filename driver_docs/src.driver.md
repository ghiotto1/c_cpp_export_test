## Folders
- **[chesslib](src/chesslib.driver.md)**: The `chesslib` folder in the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase contains C source files that collectively implement a comprehensive chess library, including functionalities for board management, move handling, game state determination, and piece movement logic.

## Files
- **[tests.c](src/tests.c.driver.md)**: The `tests.c` file in the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests for various components of a chess implementation in C, including tests for squares, moves, move lists, boards, piece moves, attacked squares, move generation, FEN generation, draw conditions, board lists, and square sets.
- **[tests.h](src/tests.h.driver.md)**: The `tests.h` file defines a series of function prototypes for testing various aspects of a Chess implementation in C, including square, move, board, and piece move functionalities.
