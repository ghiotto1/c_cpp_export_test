# Purpose
The provided code is a C++ header file, `player.h`, which defines the `Player` class for a chess game application. This class encapsulates the attributes and behaviors of a chess player, including their name, color (white or black), their king, and the set of pieces they control. The class provides a range of functionalities that are essential for managing a player's state and actions during a chess game. These functionalities include making moves, checking if the player is in check, capturing opponent pieces, and calculating the player's score based on captured pieces. The class also provides accessors to retrieve the player's name, color, set of pieces, and their king.

The `Player` class is designed to be a part of a larger chess game system, as indicated by its dependencies on other components like `Piece` and `King`, which are likely defined in the included headers `piece.h` and `king.h`. The class defines a public API with methods that allow interaction with a player's state and actions, making it a crucial component for the game's logic. The use of standard C++ libraries, such as `<set>`, suggests that the class leverages efficient data structures to manage collections of pieces. The class is structured to be instantiated with specific attributes, such as the player's name and color, and it maintains private attributes to encapsulate the player's state, ensuring that the internal data is protected and only accessible through the defined public methods.

- **Description**: The `Player` class represents a chess player in a game, encapsulating the player's name, color (white or black), and the pieces they control. It provides functionality to make moves, check if the player is in check, capture opponent pieces, and calculate the score based on captured pieces. The class maintains references to the player's king and the set of pieces they control, as well as a set of captured pieces. This structure is essential for managing the state and actions of a player within a chess game.
