# Purpose
The provided code is a C++ header file (`bishop.h`) that defines a class representing a chess bishop piece, indicating narrow functionality specific to chess game logic. This class, `Bishop`, inherits from a base class `Piece`, suggesting it is part of a larger chess application or library. The class includes a constructor to initialize the bishop with a color, a destructor, and several member functions: `value()` to return the bishop's point value, `canMoveTo()` to determine if a move to a specified square is legal, and `display()` to output the bishop's representation. The inclusion of other headers like `piece.h` and `square.h` implies dependencies on other components of the chess game, such as the general piece behavior and board squares.

### Bishop<!-- {{#data_structure:Bishop}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Description**: The `Bishop` class represents a chess bishop piece in a chess game, inheriting from the `Piece` class. It includes a constructor to initialize the bishop with a specified color, a destructor, and methods to determine the bishop's point value, check if a move to a specific square is legal based on diagonal movement, and display the bishop's representation. The class encapsulates the behavior specific to a bishop piece, such as its movement rules and display format.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`Bishop::Bishop`](bishop.cpp.driver.md#BishopBishop)
    - [`Bishop::~Bishop`](bishop.cpp.driver.md#BishopBishop)
    - [`Bishop::value`](bishop.cpp.driver.md#Bishopvalue)
    - [`Bishop::canMoveTo`](bishop.cpp.driver.md#BishopcanMoveTo)
    - [`Bishop::display`](bishop.cpp.driver.md#Bishopdisplay)
- **Inherits from**:
    - [`Piece`](piece.h.driver.md#Piece)
