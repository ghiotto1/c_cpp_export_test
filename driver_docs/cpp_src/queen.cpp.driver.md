# Purpose
The `queen.cpp` file is part of a chess software project, specifically implementing the behavior and characteristics of the Queen piece in a game of chess. This file defines the [`Queen`](#QueenQueen) class, which inherits from a base class `Piece`, indicating that it is part of a larger object-oriented design for representing chess pieces. The primary functionality provided by this file includes the construction and destruction of a [`Queen`](#QueenQueen) object, determining the value of the Queen piece, checking the validity of its moves, and displaying the piece on the board.

The [`Queen`](#QueenQueen) class encapsulates the specific movement rules of a Queen in chess, allowing it to move vertically, horizontally, or diagonally across the board, as long as the path is clear. This is achieved through the [`canMoveTo`](#QueencanMoveTo) method, which utilizes methods from a `Board` class to verify if the path is unobstructed. The [`value`](#Queenvalue) method returns the standard chess value of a Queen, which is 9, reflecting its importance in the game. The [`display`](#Queendisplay) method outputs the Queen's representation, which includes its color and the letter "Q". This file is likely part of a larger system where each chess piece is implemented in a similar manner, contributing to a comprehensive simulation of a chess game.

### Queen<!-- {{#data_structure:Queen}} -->
- **Description**: [See definition](queen.h.driver.md#Queen)
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`Queen::Queen`](#QueenQueen)
    - [`Queen::~Queen`](#QueenQueen)
    - [`Queen::value`](#Queenvalue)
    - [`Queen::canMoveTo`](#QueencanMoveTo)
    - [`Queen::display`](#Queendisplay)
- **Inherits from**:
    - `Piece`

**Methods**

---
#### Queen::Queen<!-- {{#callable:Queen::Queen}} -->
The `Queen` constructor initializes a Queen object by setting its color through the base class `Piece` constructor.
- **Inputs**:
    - `isWhite`: A boolean indicating whether the Queen is white (true) or black (false).
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor `Queen::Queen(bool isWhite)` is called with a boolean parameter `isWhite`.
    - The constructor initializes the `Queen` object by calling the base class `Piece` constructor with the `isWhite` parameter.
- **Output**:
    - There is no return value as this is a constructor for the `Queen` class.
- **See also**: [`Queen`](queen.h.driver.md#Queen)  (Data Structure)


---
#### Queen::\~Queen<!-- {{#callable:Queen::~Queen}} -->
The destructor for the Queen class is a default destructor that performs no specific actions.
- **Inputs**:
    - None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The destructor is defined but contains no code, indicating it performs no operations when a Queen object is destroyed.
- **Output**:
    - There is no output or return value from this destructor.
- **See also**: [`Queen`](queen.h.driver.md#Queen)  (Data Structure)


---
#### Queen::value<!-- {{#callable:Queen::value}} -->
The `value` function returns the fixed point value of a Queen piece in chess.
- **Inputs**:
    - None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function simply returns the integer value 9, which represents the point value of a Queen in chess.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an integer value of 9, representing the point value of a Queen piece.

---
#### Queen::canMoveTo<!-- {{#callable:Queen::canMoveTo}} -->
The `canMoveTo` function determines if a Queen chess piece can legally move to a specified square based on clear vertical, horizontal, or diagonal paths.
- **Inputs**:
    - `location`: A reference to a `Square` object representing the target location to which the Queen is attempting to move.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a boolean variable `validMove` to `false`.
    - Check if the path to the target location is clear vertically using `Board::getBoard()->isClearVertical`; if true, set `validMove` to `true`.
    - If not vertical, check if the path is clear horizontally using `Board::getBoard()->isClearHorizontal`; if true, set `validMove` to `true`.
    - If not horizontal, check if the path is clear diagonally using `Board::getBoard()->isClearDiagonal`; if true, set `validMove` to `true`.
    - Return the value of `validMove`.
- **Output**:
    - A boolean value indicating whether the Queen can legally move to the specified square.

---
#### Queen::display<!-- {{#callable:Queen::display}} -->
The `display` function outputs the Queen's color and the letter 'Q' to represent the Queen piece on the console.
- **Inputs**:
    - None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses the `cout` stream to output the Queen's color concatenated with the letter 'Q'.
- **Output**:
    - The function outputs a string to the console, representing the Queen piece with its color and the letter 'Q'.
