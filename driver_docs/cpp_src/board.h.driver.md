# Purpose
The provided code is a C++ header file, `board.h`, which defines the `Board` class. This class represents a game board, specifically an 8x8 grid, which is a common size for games like chess or checkers. The `Board` class provides a narrow but essential functionality focused on managing and interacting with the game board's squares. It includes methods to access specific squares, check for clear paths between squares in vertical, horizontal, and diagonal directions, and determine if a square is on an ending row. These functionalities are crucial for implementing game logic that involves movement and positioning on the board.

The `Board` class is designed as a singleton, indicated by the private constructor and the static method `getBoard()`, which ensures that only one instance of the board exists. The class also includes a destructor and a method to display the board's current state to an output stream. The private attributes include a static pointer `_theBoard` to hold the singleton instance and a 2D array `_squares` to represent the board's squares. The class relies on the `Square` class, which is included via the `square.h` header, suggesting that each square on the board is an instance of the `Square` class. This header file is intended to be included in other parts of the program where board functionality is required, and it defines a public API for interacting with the board.

# Data Structures

### Board<!-- {{#data_structure:Board}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `_theBoard`: A static pointer to the singleton instance of the Board class.
    - `_DIMENSION`: A constant integer representing the dimension of the board, set to 8.
    - `_squares`: A 2D array of pointers to Square objects representing the board's squares.
- **Description**: The `Board` class represents a game board, specifically an 8x8 grid, typically used for games like chess or checkers. It is implemented as a singleton, ensuring only one instance of the board exists. The board is composed of `Square` objects, each of which can be accessed via the `squareAt` method. The class provides methods to check if paths between squares are clear in vertical, horizontal, or diagonal directions, and to determine if a square is on an end row. The board can be displayed using the `display` method, which outputs the current state of the board to a given output stream.
