# Purpose
The provided code is a C++ header file (`square.h`) that defines a class `Square`, which represents a square on a game board. This class offers narrow functionality, specifically tailored for managing the state and properties of a single square, such as its position on the board and the piece occupying it. The class includes a constructor for initializing the square's position, a destructor, and several member functions to set and retrieve the square's occupier, as well as to check if the square is occupied. The use of a forward declaration for the `Piece` class suggests that this header is part of a larger system, likely a game, where pieces interact with squares on a board. The file is intended to be included in other C++ source files that require the `Square` class functionality.
# Data Structures

---
### Square<!-- {{#data_structure:Square}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `_x`: Stores the X-coordinate of the square on the board.
    - `_y`: Stores the Y-coordinate of the square on the board.
    - `_piece`: Pointer to the Piece object that occupies the square, or NULL if unoccupied.
- **Description**: The `Square` class represents a square on a game board, characterized by its X and Y coordinates and the piece that occupies it. It provides methods to set and retrieve the piece occupying the square, as well as to check if the square is occupied. The class encapsulates the position and occupancy state of a square, making it a fundamental component for board-based games.
