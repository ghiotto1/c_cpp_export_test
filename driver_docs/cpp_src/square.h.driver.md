# Purpose
The provided code is a C++ header file (`square.h`) that defines a class `Square`, which represents a square on a game board. This code offers narrow functionality, specifically tailored for managing the state and properties of a single square, such as its position on the board and the piece occupying it. The class includes constructors, a destructor, and member functions to set and retrieve the position and occupancy status of the square. It also uses a forward declaration for the `Piece` class, indicating that `Square` interacts with another class, likely representing game pieces. This header file is intended to be included in other C++ source files where the `Square` class functionality is required.
# Data Structures

---
### Square<!-- {{#data_structure:Square}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `_x`: Stores the X-coordinate of the square on the board.
    - `_y`: Stores the Y-coordinate of the square on the board.
    - `_piece`: Pointer to the Piece object that occupies the square, or NULL if unoccupied.
- **Description**: The `Square` class represents a single square on a game board, characterized by its X and Y coordinates. It can hold a reference to a `Piece` object, indicating whether the square is occupied. The class provides methods to set and retrieve the piece occupying the square, as well as to check if the square is occupied. It encapsulates the position and occupancy state of a square, making it a fundamental component for board-based games.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`Square::Square`](square.cpp.driver.md#SquareSquare)
    - [`Square::~Square`](square.cpp.driver.md#SquareSquare)
    - [`Square::setOccupier`](square.cpp.driver.md#SquaresetOccupier)
    - [`Square::getX`](square.cpp.driver.md#SquaregetX)
