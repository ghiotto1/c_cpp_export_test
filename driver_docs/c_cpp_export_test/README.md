C and C++ chess game implementation with source code, headers, tests, build instructions, and licensing.

## Folders
- **[cpp_src](cpp_src/README.md)**: C++ source and header files implementing a chess game with classes for pieces, board, player actions, and game logic.
- **[include](include/README.md)**: Header files for managing chess game components such as the board, pieces, moves, and game state.
- **[src](src/README.md)**: Implements a chess library in C with unit tests and function prototypes for various chess components.

## Files
- **[LICENSE](LICENSE.md)**: The `LICENSE` file in the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase contains the MIT License, granting permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software with certain conditions.
- **[Makefile](Makefile.md)**: The `Makefile` in the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase is used to compile and build a Chess implementation in C, handling both library and test executable creation with platform-independent configurations.
