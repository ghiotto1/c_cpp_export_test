The `Makefile` in the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase is used to compile and build a Chess implementation in C, including creating a static library and running tests.

# Purpose
This Makefile is designed for building a Chess implementation written in C. It specifies the use of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) with the `-Wall` flag to enable all compiler warnings. The file includes conditional logic to add debugging information based on the `DEBUG` variable, allowing for either debug or release builds. It defines source and object files, and handles platform independence by setting executable and library paths differently for Windows and other operating systems. The Makefile includes targets for building the chess library (`chesslib`), running tests (`tests`), and cleaning up build artifacts (`clean`). It also ensures the creation of a `bin` directory for storing compiled binaries and libraries.
