The `piece.c` file in the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase implements functions for handling chess pieces, including determining their type, color, and corresponding letter representation.

# Purpose
This C source code file provides functionality for handling chess pieces within a chess library. It defines several functions that operate on a custom data type, `piece`, which likely represents a chess piece with both type and color attributes. The file includes functions to determine the type and color of a piece ([`pieceGetType`](#pieceGetType) and [`pieceGetColor`](#pieceGetColor)), convert a piece type to its corresponding letter representation ([`pieceTypeGetLetter`](#pieceTypeGetLetter)), and obtain the letter representation of a piece considering its color ([`pieceGetLetter`](#pieceGetLetter)). Additionally, it includes a function to create a piece given its type and color ([`pieceMake`](#pieceMake)). The code is structured to handle both white and black pieces, and it uses enumerations or constants such as `pWPawn`, `pBPawn`, `ptPawn`, `pcWhite`, and `pcBlack` to represent different piece types and colors.

The file is part of a broader chess library, as indicated by the inclusion of "chesslib/piece.h", suggesting that it is intended to be used as a component within a larger chess application. The functions defined here provide a narrow but essential set of operations for managing chess pieces, focusing on their identification and representation. The code does not define a public API or external interfaces directly but rather implements internal logic that can be utilized by other parts of the chess library or application. The presence of a TODO comment suggests that the handling of empty piece types may need further consideration, indicating ongoing development or refinement.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `ctype.h`
- `chesslib/piece.h`


# Functions

---
### pieceGetType<!-- {{#callable:pieceGetType}} -->
The function `pieceGetType` determines the type of a chess piece from its encoded value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: An encoded value representing a chess piece, which includes both type and color information.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the piece `p` is greater than or equal to `pBPawn`, indicating it is a black piece.
    - If true, adjust `p` by subtracting `pBPawn` and adding 1 to normalize it to a type value.
    - Cast the adjusted or original `p` to `pieceType` and return it.
- **Output**: The function returns a `pieceType`, which is an enumeration representing the type of the chess piece (e.g., pawn, knight, bishop, etc.).


---
### pieceGetColor<!-- {{#callable:pieceGetColor}} -->
The function `pieceGetColor` determines the color of a chess piece based on its enumeration value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: An enumeration value representing a chess piece, which can be a white or black piece, or an empty piece.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the piece `p` is within the range of white pieces (`pWPawn` to `pWKing`); if true, return `pcWhite`.
    - Check if the piece `p` is within the range of black pieces (`pBPawn` to `pBKing`); if true, return `pcBlack`.
    - If neither condition is met, return `pcNoColor` indicating the piece has no color.
- **Output**: The function returns a `pieceColor` enumeration value, which can be `pcWhite`, `pcBlack`, or `pcNoColor`, indicating the color of the piece.


---
### pieceTypeGetLetter<!-- {{#callable:pieceTypeGetLetter}} -->
The function `pieceTypeGetLetter` returns the corresponding character representation of a chess piece type.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pe`: An enumeration value of type `pieceType` representing a chess piece type.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to determine the character representation based on the input `pieceType` value.
    - If `pe` is `ptPawn`, it returns 'P'.
    - If `pe` is `ptKnight`, it returns 'N'.
    - If `pe` is `ptBishop`, it returns 'B'.
    - If `pe` is `ptRook`, it returns 'R'.
    - If `pe` is `ptQueen`, it returns 'Q'.
    - If `pe` is `ptKing`, it returns 'K'.
    - If `pe` is `ptEmpty`, it returns a space character ' '.
    - If `pe` does not match any of the specified cases, it returns 0.
- **Output**: A character representing the chess piece type, or 0 if the type is unrecognized.


---
### pieceGetLetter<!-- {{#callable:pieceGetLetter}} -->
The function `pieceGetLetter` returns the character representation of a chess piece, adjusting for color by converting to lowercase if the piece is black.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` type representing a chess piece, which encodes both the type and color of the piece.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `pieceGetType(p)` to determine the type of the piece `p`.
    - Call `pieceTypeGetLetter()` with the result from `pieceGetType(p)` to get the uppercase letter representing the piece type.
    - Check the color of the piece using `pieceGetColor(p)`.
    - If the piece is black (`pcBlack`), convert the letter to lowercase using `tolower()`.
    - Return the character representing the piece, adjusted for color.
- **Output**: A `char` representing the piece type, in uppercase for white pieces and lowercase for black pieces.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](#pieceTypeGetLetter)
    - [`pieceGetType`](#pieceGetType)
    - [`pieceGetColor`](#pieceGetColor)


---
### pieceMake<!-- {{#callable:pieceMake}} -->
The `pieceMake` function creates a chess piece of a specified type and color, returning an empty piece if the color is invalid.
- **Inputs**:
    - `type`: The type of the chess piece to be created, represented by the `pieceType` enum (e.g., ptKing, ptQueen, etc.).
    - `color`: The color of the chess piece to be created, represented by the `pieceColor` enum (e.g., pcWhite, pcBlack).
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `color` is neither `pcWhite` nor `pcBlack`; if so, return `pEmpty`.
    - Use a switch statement to determine the `type` of the piece.
    - For each case in the switch statement (ptKing, ptQueen, ptRook, ptBishop, ptKnight, ptPawn), return the corresponding piece constant based on the `color` (e.g., `pWKing` for white king, `pBKing` for black king).
    - If the `type` does not match any case, return `pEmpty`.
- **Output**: The function returns a `piece` which is a specific chess piece constant based on the given type and color, or `pEmpty` if the color is invalid or the type is unrecognized.
