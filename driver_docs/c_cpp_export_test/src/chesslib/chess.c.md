The `chess.c` file implements a chess game, providing functions for creating and managing chess games, handling moves, and determining game states such as checkmate and draw conditions.

# Purpose
This C source code file implements a chess game engine, providing core functionalities for creating, managing, and interacting with a chess game state. The code is structured around a `chess` data structure, which encapsulates the state of a chess game, including the board configuration, move history, and game status. The file includes functions to initialize a chess game from a standard starting position or a given FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string, manage the game's progression by playing and undoing moves, and determine the game's terminal state, such as checkmate or draw conditions. The code also provides utility functions to retrieve various aspects of the game state, such as the current board, legal moves, and move history in UCI (Universal Chess Interface) format.

The file is part of a larger chess library, as indicated by the inclusion of headers like "chesslib/chess.h" and "chesslib/move.h". It defines a public API for interacting with the chess game, allowing external code to create and manipulate chess games through a well-defined interface. Key technical components include memory management for dynamic data structures, such as board and move lists, and logic for calculating game state properties, such as legal moves and draw conditions. The code is designed to be integrated into a larger application or library, providing a robust foundation for building chess-related software, such as a chess-playing AI or a graphical user interface for playing chess.
