C source files that implement a chess library with board management, move handling, and piece logic.


## Files
- **[board.c](board.c.md)**: The `board.c` file in the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase implements a chess board, including functions for creating a board from a FEN string, generating legal moves, checking for check and checkmate, and converting the board state back to a FEN string.
- **[boardlist.c](boardlist.c.md)**: The `boardlist.c` file implements a singly linked list for managing a list of chess boards, including functions to create, add, retrieve, undo, and free the list.
- **[chess.c](chess.c.md)**: The `chess.c` file implements a chess game, providing functions for creating and managing chess games, handling moves, and determining game states such as checkmate and draw conditions.
- **[move.c](move.c.md)**: The `move.c` file in the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase implements functions for handling chess moves, including creating moves, comparing them, and converting between moves and UCI strings.
- **[movelist.c](movelist.c.md)**: The `movelist.c` file implements a linked list structure for managing chess moves, including functions for creating, adding, retrieving, undoing moves, and generating a UCI string representation of the move list.
- **[piece.c](piece.c.md)**: The `piece.c` file in the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase implements functions for handling chess pieces, including determining their type, color, and corresponding letter representation.
- **[piecemoves.c](piecemoves.c.md)**: The `piecemoves.c` file in the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase implements the movement logic for chess pieces, including pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings, while avoiding circular dependencies.
- **[square.c](square.c.md)**: The `square.c` file in the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase provides functions for creating and manipulating chessboard squares, including conversion between different representations and checking square properties.
- **[squareset.c](squareset.c.md)**: The `squareset.c` file implements functions for setting and getting values in a square set, which is part of a chess library.
