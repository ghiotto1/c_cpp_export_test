The `chesslib` folder implements a chess library in C, and `tests.c` and `tests.h` provide unit tests and function prototypes.

## Folders
- **[chesslib](chesslib/README.md)**: C source files that implement a chess library with board management, move handling, and piece logic.

## Files
- **[tests.c](tests.c.md)**: The `tests.c` file in the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests for various components of a chess implementation in C, including tests for squares, moves, move lists, boards, piece moves, attacked squares, move generation, FEN generation, and draw conditions.
- **[tests.h](tests.h.md)**: The `tests.h` file defines function prototypes for various test cases related to a Chess implementation in C, including tests for squares, moves, boards, and FEN generation.
