Header files that define structures and functions for managing chess game aspects like board, pieces, moves, and game state.


## Files
- **[board.h](board.h.md)**: The `board.h` file defines the structure and functions for managing a chess board, including initialization, move generation, and state comparison, within the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase.
- **[boardlist.h](boardlist.h.md)**: The `boardlist.h` file defines a linked list structure and operations for managing a list of chess boards, including creation, addition, retrieval, undo, and memory deallocation.
- **[chess.h](chess.h.md)**: The `chess.h` file defines the structures and functions necessary for managing a chess game, including game initialization, move handling, and draw claims, within the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase.
- **[move.h](move.h.md)**: The `move.h` file defines structures and functions for representing and manipulating chess moves, including conversion to and from UCI notation.
- **[movelist.h](movelist.h.md)**: The `movelist.h` file defines data structures and functions for managing a list of chess moves, including creation, addition, retrieval, and conversion to UCI string format.
- **[piece.h](piece.h.md)**: The `piece.h` file defines enumerations and functions for representing and manipulating chess pieces, including their types, colors, and corresponding letters.
- **[piecemoves.h](piecemoves.h.md)**: The `piecemoves.h` file defines functions for generating potential move lists for different chess pieces, including leapers, riders, and specific pieces like pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings, while avoiding circular dependencies.
- **[square.h](square.h.md)**: The `square.h` file defines a `sq` struct for representing chessboard squares, along with functions for creating, indexing, and comparing these squares, as well as determining their color.
- **[squareset.h](squareset.h.md)**: The `squareset.h` file defines a 64-bit square set for representing the state of each square on a chessboard and includes functions to set and get the state of individual squares.
