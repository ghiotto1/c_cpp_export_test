The `piece.h` file defines enumerations and functions for representing and manipulating chess pieces, including their types, colors, and corresponding letters.

# Purpose
This C header file defines enumerations and function prototypes related to chess pieces, likely for use in a chess game application. It includes three enumerations: `pieceType`, which categorizes the types of chess pieces (e.g., pawn, knight, etc.); `piece`, which represents specific pieces with their color (e.g., white pawn, black knight, etc.); and `pieceColor`, which distinguishes between no color, white, and black. The file also declares several functions: [`pieceGetType`](#pieceGetType) and [`pieceGetColor`](#pieceGetColor) for retrieving the type and color of a piece, respectively; [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](#pieceTypeGetLetter) and [`pieceGetLetter`](#pieceGetLetter) for obtaining a character representation of a piece type or specific piece; and [`pieceMake`](#pieceMake) for creating a piece given its type and color. This header file is essential for managing and manipulating chess pieces within the broader context of a chess program.
# Data Structures

---
### pieceType
- **Type**: `enum`
- **Members**:
    - `ptEmpty`: Represents an empty square or no piece.
    - `ptPawn`: Represents a pawn piece.
    - `ptKnight`: Represents a knight piece.
    - `ptBishop`: Represents a bishop piece.
    - `ptRook`: Represents a rook piece.
    - `ptQueen`: Represents a queen piece.
    - `ptKing`: Represents a king piece.
- **Description**: The `pieceType` enum defines the different types of chess pieces that can exist on a chessboard, including an empty state to represent the absence of a piece. Each enumerator corresponds to a specific type of chess piece, allowing for easy identification and manipulation of pieces within a chess program.


---
### piece
- **Type**: `enum`
- **Members**:
    - `pEmpty`: Represents an empty square on the chessboard.
    - `pWPawn`: Represents a white pawn piece.
    - `pWKnight`: Represents a white knight piece.
    - `pWBishop`: Represents a white bishop piece.
    - `pWRook`: Represents a white rook piece.
    - `pWQueen`: Represents a white queen piece.
    - `pWKing`: Represents a white king piece.
    - `pBPawn`: Represents a black pawn piece.
    - `pBKnight`: Represents a black knight piece.
    - `pBBishop`: Represents a black bishop piece.
    - `pBRook`: Represents a black rook piece.
    - `pBQueen`: Represents a black queen piece.
    - `pBKing`: Represents a black king piece.
- **Description**: The 'piece' enum is a data structure used to represent the different types of chess pieces in a game, including both white and black pieces, as well as an empty square. Each enumerator corresponds to a specific piece, allowing for easy identification and manipulation of chess pieces within the program.


---
### pieceColor
- **Type**: `enum`
- **Members**:
    - `pcNoColor`: Represents a piece with no color.
    - `pcWhite`: Represents a white-colored piece.
    - `pcBlack`: Represents a black-colored piece.
- **Description**: The `pieceColor` enum is used to define the color of a chess piece, with possible values indicating no color, white, or black. This enumeration is essential for distinguishing between the two opposing sides in a chess game, allowing for operations and logic that depend on the color of the pieces.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### pieceGetType<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceGetType}} -->
Retrieve the type of a chess piece.
- **Description**: This function is used to determine the type of a given chess piece, such as pawn, knight, bishop, etc. It is useful when you need to identify the role of a piece on the board, regardless of its color. The function expects a valid piece enumeration value as input and will return the corresponding piece type. It handles both white and black pieces by normalizing the input to a common type enumeration. Ensure that the input is a valid piece value to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A value of type `piece` representing a chess piece. It must be a valid enumeration value from the `piece` enum, such as `pWPawn`, `pBKnight`, etc. Invalid values may lead to undefined behavior.
- **Output**: Returns a `pieceType` enumeration value corresponding to the type of the input piece, such as `ptPawn`, `ptKnight`, etc.
- **See also**: [`pieceGetType`](../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#pieceGetType)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceGetColor<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceGetColor}} -->
Determines the color of a chess piece.
- **Description**: Use this function to identify the color of a given chess piece. It is useful when you need to differentiate between white and black pieces in a chess game. The function expects a valid piece enumeration value and returns the corresponding color. If the piece does not correspond to a valid white or black piece, the function returns a value indicating no color. This function is typically used in chess game logic to handle piece-specific operations based on color.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A chess piece represented by the 'piece' enumeration. It must be a valid piece value, such as pWPawn or pBKing. If the value does not correspond to a defined piece, the function will return pcNoColor.
- **Output**: Returns a 'pieceColor' enumeration value indicating the color of the piece: pcWhite for white pieces, pcBlack for black pieces, and pcNoColor if the piece is not a valid white or black piece.
- **See also**: [`pieceGetColor`](../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#pieceGetColor)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceTypeGetLetter<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceTypeGetLetter}} -->
Returns the character representation of a chess piece type.
- **Description**: This function provides a character representation for a given chess piece type, which can be useful for displaying or logging purposes. It maps each piece type to a specific character: 'P' for pawn, 'N' for knight, 'B' for bishop, 'R' for rook, 'Q' for queen, 'K' for king, and a space character for an empty piece type. If the input does not match any defined piece type, the function returns a null character. This function should be used when a textual representation of a piece type is needed, and it assumes that the input is a valid pieceType enumeration value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pe`: The piece type to be converted to a character. It must be a valid value from the pieceType enumeration. If the value is not recognized, the function returns a null character.
- **Output**: The function returns a character corresponding to the given piece type, or a null character if the input is invalid.
- **See also**: [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#pieceTypeGetLetter)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceGetLetter<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceGetLetter}} -->
Returns the character representation of a chess piece.
- **Description**: This function provides the character representation of a given chess piece, which is useful for displaying or logging the piece in a human-readable format. The character returned corresponds to the type of the piece, with uppercase letters representing white pieces and lowercase letters representing black pieces. It is important to ensure that the input piece is valid, as the function relies on the piece's type and color to determine the correct character. The function does not handle invalid piece values explicitly, so the caller should ensure that the piece is within the defined enumeration.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A chess piece of type `piece`, which must be a valid value from the `piece` enumeration. The caller retains ownership and must ensure the piece is valid, as invalid values may lead to undefined behavior.
- **Output**: The function returns a `char` representing the piece's type, with the case indicating the piece's color (uppercase for white, lowercase for black).
- **See also**: [`pieceGetLetter`](../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#pieceGetLetter)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceMake<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceMake}} -->
Create a chess piece of a specified type and color.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a chess piece by specifying its type and color. It is essential to provide a valid piece type and a valid color (either white or black) to obtain a meaningful piece. If the color is invalid, the function returns an empty piece. Similarly, if the type is not recognized, the function also returns an empty piece. This function is useful for initializing or manipulating chess pieces in a program that simulates or manages a chess game.
- **Inputs**:
    - `type`: Specifies the type of the chess piece to create. Must be one of the defined pieceType values (e.g., ptKing, ptQueen). If an unrecognized type is provided, the function returns pEmpty.
    - `color`: Specifies the color of the chess piece. Must be either pcWhite or pcBlack. If an invalid color is provided, the function returns pEmpty.
- **Output**: Returns a piece of the specified type and color, or pEmpty if the inputs are invalid.
- **See also**: [`pieceMake`](../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#pieceMake)  (Implementation)
