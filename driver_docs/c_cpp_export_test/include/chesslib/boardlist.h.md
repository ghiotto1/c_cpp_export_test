The `boardlist.h` file defines a linked list structure and operations for managing a list of chess boards, including creation, addition, retrieval, undo, and memory deallocation.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a data structure and associated operations for managing a linked list of chess boards, likely as part of a larger chess application. It includes the definition of two structures: `boardListNode`, which represents a node in the linked list containing a pointer to a `board` and a pointer to the next node, and `boardList`, which manages the linked list with pointers to the head and tail nodes and tracks the list's size. The file declares functions for creating and managing these lists, including creating new lists and nodes, adding boards to the list, retrieving a board by index, undoing the last addition, and freeing the entire list. This header file is essential for organizing and manipulating sequences of chess board states, which can be useful for implementing features like move history or undo functionality in a chess program.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `stddef.h`
- `chesslib/board.h`


# Data Structures

---
### boardListNode
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `board`: A pointer to a board structure, representing a chess board.
    - `next`: A pointer to the next node in the linked list, allowing traversal.
- **Description**: The `boardListNode` is a node structure used in a linked list to store and manage a sequence of chess boards. Each node contains a pointer to a `board` structure, which represents a chess board, and a pointer to the next `boardListNode`, enabling the creation of a singly linked list. This structure is part of a larger system for managing a list of chess boards, allowing operations such as adding, retrieving, and undoing moves in a chess game.


---
### boardList
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `head`: A pointer to the first node in the board list.
    - `tail`: A pointer to the last node in the board list.
    - `size`: The number of nodes currently in the board list.
- **Description**: The `boardList` structure is a linked list designed to manage a sequence of `board` objects, which are presumably part of a chess library. It maintains pointers to the first (`head`) and last (`tail`) nodes of the list, allowing for efficient additions to the end of the list. The `size` member keeps track of the total number of nodes in the list, facilitating operations that depend on the list's length. This structure is useful for managing dynamic collections of chess boards, such as in a game history or move sequence.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### boardListCreate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListCreate}} -->
Create an empty board list.
- **Description**: This function initializes and returns a new, empty board list, which is a data structure designed to hold a sequence of board elements. It allocates memory for the board list and sets its initial state with no elements. This function should be called when a new board list is needed, and the caller is responsible for managing the memory of the returned list, including eventually freeing it with `boardListFree` to avoid memory leaks.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: A pointer to a newly allocated `boardList` structure, initialized to be empty.
- **See also**: [`boardListCreate`](c_cpp_export_test/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#callable:boardListCreate)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListNodeCreate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListNodeCreate}} -->
Creates a new board list node with the specified board.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a new node for a linked list of boards, initializing it with a given board. This function allocates memory for the node, sets its board pointer to the provided board, and initializes the next pointer to NULL. It is typically used when constructing or extending a linked list of boards. Ensure that the provided board pointer is valid and that the caller manages the memory for the board itself. The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated node to prevent memory leaks.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a board structure that the new node will reference. Must be a valid pointer, and the caller retains ownership of the board. The function does not check for null pointers, so passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
- **Output**: A pointer to the newly created boardListNode, or NULL if memory allocation fails.
- **See also**: [`boardListNodeCreate`](c_cpp_export_test/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#callable:boardListNodeCreate)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListAdd<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListAdd}} -->
Adds a board to the end of a board list.
- **Description**: This function appends a new board to the end of the specified board list. It should be used when you want to maintain a sequence of boards, such as in a game history. The function assumes that the list has been properly initialized and is not null. It updates the list's head and tail pointers as necessary and increments the size of the list. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the board pointer is valid and that the list is in a consistent state before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a boardList structure where the board will be added. Must not be null and should be properly initialized.
    - `b`: A pointer to a board structure to be added to the list. Must not be null and should point to a valid board.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`boardListAdd`](c_cpp_export_test/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#callable:boardListAdd)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListGet<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListGet}} -->
Retrieve a board from the board list at the specified index.
- **Description**: Use this function to access a specific board from a board list by providing the index of the desired board. The function assumes that the index is within the bounds of the list, meaning it should be less than the size of the list. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the index is valid, as providing an out-of-bounds index will result in undefined behavior. This function does not modify the list or the boards within it.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a boardList from which a board is to be retrieved. Must not be null, and should point to a valid, initialized boardList.
    - `index`: An unsigned integer representing the position of the board to retrieve. Must be less than the size of the list to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Output**: A pointer to the board at the specified index in the list. The caller does not take ownership of the board.
- **See also**: [`boardListGet`](c_cpp_export_test/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#callable:boardListGet)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListUndo<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListUndo}} -->
Removes the last board from the board list.
- **Description**: Use this function to remove the most recently added board from a `boardList`. It should be called when you need to undo the last operation that added a board to the list. The function safely handles cases where the list is empty or contains only one board, ensuring no operation is performed if the list is already empty. It decrements the size of the list accordingly and updates the list's tail pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` structure. Must not be null. The function does nothing if the list is null or empty.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`boardListUndo`](c_cpp_export_test/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#callable:boardListUndo)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListFree<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListFree}} -->
Frees all memory associated with a board list.
- **Description**: Use this function to release all memory allocated for a board list and its nodes when the list is no longer needed. This function should be called to prevent memory leaks after you are done using the board list. It is important to ensure that the list pointer is valid and that the list has been properly initialized before calling this function. After calling this function, the list pointer should not be used unless it is reinitialized.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a boardList structure that must have been previously allocated and initialized. The pointer must not be null, and the function will free all associated memory, including the boards within each node.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`boardListFree`](c_cpp_export_test/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#callable:boardListFree)  (Implementation)
