The `movelist.h` file defines data structures and functions for managing a list of chess moves, including creation, addition, retrieval, and conversion to UCI string format.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a data structure and associated operations for managing a list of chess moves, likely as part of a larger chess application. It includes the definition of two structures: `moveListNode`, which represents a single node containing a chess move and a pointer to the next node, and `moveList`, which manages the linked list of these nodes, including pointers to the head and tail of the list and a size counter. The file declares several functions for creating and manipulating these lists, such as adding moves, retrieving moves by index, undoing the last move, and converting the list to a UCI (Universal Chess Interface) string format. Additionally, it provides a function to free the memory used by the list and its nodes, ensuring proper resource management. This header file is essential for handling sequences of moves in a chess game, facilitating operations like move tracking and conversion to standard formats.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Data Structures

---
### moveListNode
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `move`: A move object representing a single move in a chess game.
    - `next`: A pointer to the next moveListNode in the linked list.
- **Description**: The `moveListNode` is a structure used to represent a node in a linked list of chess moves. Each node contains a `move` object, which holds the details of a single chess move, and a `next` pointer, which points to the subsequent node in the list. This structure is part of a larger system for managing sequences of chess moves, allowing for operations such as adding moves, retrieving moves by index, and undoing moves.


---
### moveList
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `head`: A pointer to the first node in the move list.
    - `tail`: A pointer to the last node in the move list.
    - `size`: The number of nodes currently in the move list.
- **Description**: The `moveList` structure is a linked list data structure used to store a sequence of moves in a chess game. It contains pointers to the head and tail of the list, allowing for efficient addition of moves to the end of the list. The `size` member keeps track of the total number of moves stored in the list, facilitating operations that require knowledge of the list's length. This structure is designed to support operations such as adding new moves, retrieving moves by index, undoing the last move, and converting the list of moves into a UCI (Universal Chess Interface) string format.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### moveListCreate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListCreate}} -->
Create an empty move list.
- **Description**: This function initializes and returns a new, empty move list, which is a data structure used to store a sequence of moves. It allocates memory for the move list and sets its initial state with no moves. The function should be called when a new move list is needed, and the caller is responsible for managing the memory of the returned list, including freeing it when it is no longer needed using the appropriate function.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: A pointer to a newly allocated moveList structure, initialized to be empty.
- **See also**: [`moveListCreate`](../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#moveListCreate)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListNodeCreate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListNodeCreate}} -->
Create a new move list node with a specified move.
- **Description**: This function is used to create a new node for a move list, initializing it with a specified move. It allocates memory for the node and sets the move field to the provided move, while the next pointer is initialized to NULL. This function is typically used when constructing or modifying a move list in a chess application. Ensure that the allocated node is eventually freed to avoid memory leaks.
- **Inputs**:
    - `move`: The move to be stored in the new node. It must be a valid move as defined by the chess library. The caller retains ownership of the move data.
- **Output**: A pointer to the newly created moveListNode containing the specified move, or NULL if memory allocation fails.
- **See also**: [`moveListNodeCreate`](../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#moveListNodeCreate)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListAdd<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListAdd}} -->
Adds a move to the end of a move list.
- **Description**: This function appends a new move to the end of the specified move list, updating the list's size accordingly. It is typically used to build or extend a sequence of moves in a chess game. The function assumes that the move list has been properly initialized before calling. If the list is empty, the new move becomes both the head and the tail of the list. The function does not handle invalid input and expects the list pointer to be valid.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a moveList structure where the move will be added. Must not be null and should be properly initialized before calling.
    - `move`: The move to be added to the list. It is assumed to be a valid move as per the move type definition.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`moveListAdd`](../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#moveListAdd)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListGet<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListGet}} -->
Retrieve a move from the move list at the specified index.
- **Description**: This function retrieves a move from a move list at a specified index, allowing access to individual moves within the list. It is useful when you need to examine or process a specific move from a sequence of moves stored in a move list. The function assumes that the index provided is within the bounds of the list, meaning it should be less than the size of the list. If the index is out of bounds, the behavior is undefined, so it is the caller's responsibility to ensure the index is valid.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a moveList from which the move will be retrieved. Must not be null, and should point to a valid moveList structure.
    - `index`: An unsigned integer representing the position of the move to retrieve. Must be less than the size of the list to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Output**: The move located at the specified index in the move list.
- **See also**: [`moveListGet`](../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#moveListGet)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListUndo<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListUndo}} -->
Removes the last move from the move list.
- **Description**: Use this function to remove the most recently added move from a move list, effectively undoing the last move. This function should be called when you need to backtrack or reverse the last move in a sequence. It is important to ensure that the move list is not null and contains at least one move before calling this function, as it will not perform any action if the list is empty or null. The function updates the list's size and tail pointer accordingly.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a moveList structure representing the list of moves. Must not be null and should contain at least one move. If the list is null or empty, the function does nothing.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`moveListUndo`](../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#moveListUndo)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListGetUciString<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListGetUciString}} -->
Creates a UCI string representation of the moves in the given move list.
- **Description**: This function generates a string in UCI (Universal Chess Interface) format representing all the moves contained in the provided move list. It is useful for converting a sequence of chess moves into a standardized string format for further processing or communication with UCI-compatible chess engines. The function allocates memory for the resulting string, which the caller is responsible for freeing. If the move list is empty, the function returns an empty string. The function assumes that the move list is properly initialized and populated with valid moves.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a moveList structure containing the moves to be converted. The list must be initialized and can be empty. The caller retains ownership of the list, and it must not be null.
- **Output**: A dynamically allocated string containing the UCI representation of the moves in the list. The caller is responsible for freeing this string. If the list is empty, an empty string is returned.
- **See also**: [`moveListGetUciString`](../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#moveListGetUciString)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListFree<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListFree}} -->
Frees a move list and all its nodes.
- **Description**: Use this function to release all memory associated with a move list, including all its nodes. It should be called when the move list is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. Ensure that the list pointer is valid and was previously allocated by moveListCreate. After calling this function, the list pointer should not be used unless it is reinitialized.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a moveList structure that must have been created by moveListCreate. The pointer must not be null, and it is the caller's responsibility to ensure the list is not used after being freed.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`moveListFree`](../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#moveListFree)  (Implementation)
