The `board.cpp` file implements a chess board for the ChessProject, including methods for board setup, checking clear paths for moves, and displaying the board state.

# Purpose
The `board.cpp` file is part of a Chess project and is responsible for implementing the [`Board`](#BoardBoard) class, which models the chessboard in the game. This file provides a focused functionality centered around managing the state and behavior of the chessboard. The [`Board`](#BoardBoard) class includes methods for initializing the board, checking the clarity of paths (vertical, horizontal, and diagonal) between squares, and displaying the board's current state. The class uses a singleton pattern, as evidenced by the `getBoard()` method, which ensures that only one instance of the [`Board`](#BoardBoard) exists throughout the application. This is achieved by maintaining a static pointer `_theBoard` to the single instance.

The technical components of this file include the constructor and destructor for setting up and cleaning up the board, respectively, and several methods for checking the state of the board, such as [`isClearVertical`](#BoardisClearVertical), [`isClearHorizontal`](#BoardisClearHorizontal), and [`isClearDiagonal`](#BoardisClearDiagonal). These methods are crucial for validating moves in a chess game by ensuring that no pieces obstruct the path between two squares. The [`display`](#Boarddisplay) method outputs the current state of the board to a given output stream, showing the position of pieces on the board. The file also includes a method [`isEndRow`](#BoardisEndRow) to determine if a square is on the end row, which is significant for pawn promotion in chess. Overall, `board.cpp` is a critical component of the Chess project, providing essential functionality for managing and interacting with the chessboard.

#### Board::Board<!-- {{#callable:Board::Board}} -->
The `Board` constructor initializes an 8x8 chess board by creating `Square` objects for each position on the board.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor iterates over a fixed dimension (8x8) using two nested loops.
    - For each pair of indices (i, j), it creates a new `Square` object with coordinates (i, j).
    - The newly created `Square` object is stored in the `_squares` array at position [i][j].
- **Output**: The constructor does not return any value as it is a constructor for the `Board` class.
- **See also**: [`Board`](board.h.md#Board)  (Data Structure)


---
#### Board::\~Board<!-- {{#callable:Board::~Board}} -->
The `~Board` destructor deallocates memory for a dynamically allocated 2D array of `Square` objects in a chess board.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Iterate over each row of the `_squares` 2D array using a loop with index `i`.
    - Within each row, iterate over each column using a loop with index `j`.
    - For each `Square` object at position `[i][j]`, deallocate its memory using `delete[]`.
    - After deallocating all `Square` objects in a row, deallocate the memory for the row itself using `delete[]`.
    - Finally, deallocate the memory for the entire `_squares` array using `delete[]`.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value as it is a destructor.

---
#### Board::isClearVertical<!-- {{#callable:Board::isClearVertical}} -->
The `isClearVertical` function checks if the vertical path between two squares on a board is clear of any occupied squares.
- **Inputs**:
    - `from`: A reference to the starting `Square` object.
    - `to`: A reference to the ending `Square` object.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize pointers `start` and `end` to determine the order of squares based on their y-values.
    - Assign `start` to the square with the smaller y-value and `end` to the other square.
    - Check if the x-values of `start` and `end` are equal to ensure no horizontal movement; if not, set `valid` to false.
    - If the x-values are equal, iterate over the y-values between `start` and `end`.
    - For each square in the vertical path, check if it is occupied using the [`squareAt`](#BoardsquareAt) method.
    - If any square is occupied, set `valid` to false.
    - Return the boolean value `valid` indicating if the path is clear.

    - `to`: A reference to the ending `Square` object.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize pointers `start` and `end` to determine the direction of horizontal traversal based on the x-values of `from` and `to`.
    - Check if there is no vertical movement by comparing the y-values of `start` and `end`; if they differ, set `valid` to false.
    - If the y-values are the same, iterate over the x-values between `start` and `end` to check if any square is occupied.
    - If any square in the path is occupied, set `valid` to false.
    - Return the boolean value `valid` indicating whether the path is clear.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether the horizontal path between the two squares is clear (true) or not (false).

#### Board::isClearDiagonal<!-- {{#callable:Board::isClearDiagonal}} -->
The `isClearDiagonal` function checks if the diagonal path between two squares on a chess board is unobstructed by any pieces.
- **Inputs**:
    - `from`: A reference to the starting `Square` object on the board.
    - `to`: A reference to the ending `Square` object on the board.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `valid` as true, and calculate the translation in x and y directions between the `from` and `to` squares.
    - Determine the direction of movement in x (`xDir`) and y (`yDir`) based on the sign of the translations.
    - Check if the movement is diagonal by comparing the absolute values of the x and y translations; if they don't match, set `valid` to false.
    - If the movement is diagonal, iterate over each square along the diagonal path (excluding the start and end squares).

The `isEndRow` function checks if a given square is located on the first or last row of the board.
- **Inputs**:
    - `location`: A reference to a `Square` object representing the location on the board to be checked.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the Y-coordinate of the `location` square using `location.getY()`.
    - Check if the Y-coordinate is either 0 or `_DIMENSION - 1`, which represent the first and last rows of the board, respectively.

- **Inputs**:
    - `outStream`: An output stream where the board's current state will be printed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by printing the column labels (a to h) and a separator line to the output stream.
    - It then iterates over each row of the board from top to bottom (black pieces at the top, white at the bottom).
    - For each row, it prints the row number, followed by the contents of each square in that row, separated by vertical bars.
    - If a square is occupied, it calls the `display` method of the piece occupying the square to print its representation; otherwise, it prints an empty space.
    - After printing all squares in a row, it prints the row number again and a separator line.
    - Finally, it prints the column labels again at the bottom of the board.
- **Output**: The function outputs the visual representation of the chess board to the provided output stream, showing the positions of any pieces on the board.
