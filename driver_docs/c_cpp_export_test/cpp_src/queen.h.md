The `queen.h` file defines a `Queen` class representing a chess queen piece, including methods for determining legal moves, getting its point value, and displaying the piece.

# Purpose
The provided code is a C++ header file (`queen.h`) that defines a class representing a chess queen piece, offering narrow functionality specific to chess game logic. This class, `Queen`, inherits from a base class `Piece`, suggesting a broader chess game framework where different pieces share common characteristics. The class includes a constructor to initialize a queen with a specified color, a destructor, and several member functions: `value()` to return the point value of the queen, `canMoveTo()` to determine if a move to a specified square is legal, and `display()` to output the queen's representation. The header file is intended to be included in other parts of a chess application, likely alongside implementations in corresponding source files.

### Queen<!-- {{#data_structure:Queen}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Description**: The `Queen` class represents a chess queen piece in a chess game, inheriting from the `Piece` class. It encapsulates the behavior and characteristics of a queen, including its ability to move vertically, horizontally, or diagonally across the board, as determined by the `canMoveTo` method. The class also provides a method to retrieve the point value of the queen, which is 9, and a method to display the queen on the board. The constructor initializes the queen with a specified color, and the class includes a destructor for cleanup.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`Queen::Queen`](queen.cpp.md#QueenQueen)
    - [`Queen::~Queen`](queen.cpp.md#QueenQueen)
    - [`Queen::value`](queen.cpp.md#Queenvalue)
    - [`Queen::canMoveTo`](queen.cpp.md#QueencanMoveTo)
    - [`Queen::display`](queen.cpp.md#Queendisplay)
- **Inherits From**:
    - `Piece`
