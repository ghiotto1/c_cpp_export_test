The `game.h` file defines a class for representing a game of chess, including methods for initializing the game and managing player turns.

# Purpose
The provided code is a C++ header file (`game.h`) that defines a class representing a game of chess, indicating narrow functionality specific to chess game management. This header file is intended to be included in other C++ source files, as it declares the `Game` class with methods and attributes necessary for setting up and managing a chess game. The class includes static methods for initializing the game, determining the next player, and identifying the opponent of a given player, suggesting that it manages game state and player turns. The use of static attributes and methods implies that the class is designed to handle a single game instance at a time, with private attributes for storing player and piece information. The inclusion of other headers like `board.h`, `piece.h`, and `player.h` suggests that this class interacts with other components of a chess game system.

# Data Structures

---
### Game<!-- {{#data_structure:Game}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `player1`: A static pointer to the first player in the game, representing the white player.
    - `player2`: A static pointer to the second player in the game, representing the black player.
    - `nextPlayer`: A static pointer to the player whose turn is next.
    - `whitePieces`: A static set containing pointers to all the white pieces in the game.
    - `blackPieces`: A static set containing pointers to all the black pieces in the game.
- **Description**: The `Game` class represents a game of chess, managing the players and pieces involved. It includes static methods to initialize the game, determine the next player, and find the opponent of a given player. The class maintains static attributes for the two players, the next player to move, and sets of pieces for both white and black sides. The class is designed to encapsulate the state and behavior of a chess game, providing functionality to manage the game's lifecycle and player interactions.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`Game::Game`](game.cpp.md#GameGame)
    - [`Game::~Game`](game.cpp.md#GameGame)
    - [`Game::initialize`](game.cpp.md#Gameinitialize)
    - [`Game::getNextPlayer`](game.cpp.md#GamegetNextPlayer)
    - [`Game::opponentOf`](game.cpp.md#GameopponentOf)
