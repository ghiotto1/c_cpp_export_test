The `board.h` file defines a `Board` class representing an 8x8 game board, including methods for accessing squares, checking clear paths, determining end rows, and displaying the board.

# Purpose
The provided code is a C++ header file (`board.h`) that defines a class `Board`, which represents a game board, likely for a board game such as chess or checkers. This code offers narrow functionality specific to managing and interacting with a game board, including methods to access specific squares, check clear paths between squares in various directions (vertical, horizontal, diagonal), and determine if a square is on an end row. The class also includes a method to display the board, suggesting it might be used in a console-based application. The `Board` class is implemented as a singleton, indicated by the static method `getBoard()` and the private static member `_theBoard`, ensuring only one instance of the board exists. The board is fixed at an 8x8 dimension, as defined by the constant `_DIMENSION`, and it relies on a `Square` class, which is presumably defined in the included "square.h" file.

# Data Structures

---
### Board<!-- {{#data_structure:Board}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `_theBoard`: A static pointer to the singleton instance of the Board class.
    - `_DIMENSION`: A static constant integer representing the dimension of the board, set to 8.
    - `_squares`: A 2D array of pointers to Square objects, representing the squares on the board.
- **Description**: The Board class represents a game board, specifically an 8x8 grid, typically used for games like chess or checkers. It is implemented as a singleton, ensuring only one instance of the board exists at any time. The class provides methods to access specific squares, check if paths between squares are clear in vertical, horizontal, or diagonal directions, and determine if a square is on an end row. It also includes functionality to display the board's current state. The board is initialized with each square being an instance of the Square class, and it manages the memory for these squares, ensuring they are properly allocated and deallocated.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`Board::Board`](board.cpp.md#BoardBoard)
    - [`Board::~Board`](board.cpp.md#BoardBoard)
    - [`Board::getBoard`](board.cpp.md#BoardgetBoard)
    - [`Board::squareAt`](board.cpp.md#BoardsquareAt)
    - [`Board::isClearVertical`](board.cpp.md#BoardisClearVertical)
    - [`Board::isClearHorizontal`](board.cpp.md#BoardisClearHorizontal)
    - [`Board::isClearDiagonal`](board.cpp.md#BoardisClearDiagonal)
    - [`Board::isEndRow`](board.cpp.md#BoardisEndRow)
    - [`Board::display`](board.cpp.md#Boarddisplay)
