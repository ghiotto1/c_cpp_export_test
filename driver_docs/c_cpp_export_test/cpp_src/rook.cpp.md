The `rook.cpp` file implements the Rook chess piece, including its movement logic and display functionality, for the ChessProject.

# Purpose
The provided code is a C++ implementation file (`rook.cpp`) for a class named [`Rook`](#RookRook), which is part of a chess game project. This file defines the behavior and characteristics of a rook piece in chess, inheriting from a base class `RestrictedPiece`. The functionality is relatively narrow, focusing specifically on the movement and display logic of a rook. The [`Rook`](#RookRook) class includes a constructor and destructor, a method to return the piece's value (`value()`), a method to determine if a move is valid based on chess rules for rooks (`canMoveTo()`), and a method to display the rook on the console (`display()`). The `canMoveTo()` function checks if the rook can move vertically or horizontally without obstruction, utilizing methods from a `Board` class. This file is intended to be part of a larger chess application, likely imported and used alongside other piece implementations.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `rook.h`


# Data Structures

---
### Rook<!-- {{#data_structure:Rook}} -->
- **Description**: [See definition](rook.h.md#Rook)
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`Rook::Rook`](#RookRook)
    - [`Rook::~Rook`](#RookRook)
    - [`Rook::value`](#Rookvalue)
    - [`Rook::canMoveTo`](#RookcanMoveTo)
    - [`Rook::display`](#Rookdisplay)
- **Inherits From**:
    - `RestrictedPiece`

**Methods**

---
#### Rook::Rook<!-- {{#callable:Rook::Rook}} -->
The Rook constructor initializes a Rook object by calling the constructor of its parent class, RestrictedPiece, with a boolean indicating the piece's color.
- **Inputs**:
    - `isWhite`: A boolean value indicating whether the Rook is white (true) or black (false).
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor of the Rook class is called with a boolean parameter 'isWhite'.
    - The constructor of the parent class, RestrictedPiece, is invoked with the 'isWhite' parameter to initialize the Rook object.
- **Output**: There is no output from this constructor function; it initializes a Rook object.
- **See also**: [`Rook`](rook.h.md#Rook)  (Data Structure)


---
#### Rook::\~Rook<!-- {{#callable:Rook::~Rook}} -->
The destructor for the Rook class is a default destructor that performs no specific actions.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The destructor is called when a Rook object is destroyed.
    - No specific actions or resource deallocations are performed within the destructor.
- **Output**: There is no output from this destructor as it performs no operations.
- **See also**: [`Rook`](rook.h.md#Rook)  (Data Structure)


---
#### Rook::value<!-- {{#callable:Rook::value}} -->
The `value` function returns the fixed point value of a Rook piece in a chess game.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is a constant member function of the `Rook` class, indicating it does not modify the state of the object.
    - It directly returns the integer value `5`, which represents the point value of a Rook in chess.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of `5`.
- **See also**: [`Rook`](rook.h.md#Rook)  (Data Structure)


---
#### Rook::canMoveTo<!-- {{#callable:Rook::canMoveTo}} -->
The `canMoveTo` function determines if a Rook can legally move to a specified square by checking for clear vertical or horizontal paths on the board.
- **Inputs**:
    - `location`: A reference to a `Square` object representing the target location to which the Rook is attempting to move.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a boolean variable `validMove` to `false`.
    - Check if the path from the Rook's current location to the target location is clear vertically using `Board::getBoard()->isClearVertical`.
    - If the vertical path is clear, set `validMove` to `true`.
    - If the vertical path is not clear, check if the path is clear horizontally using `Board::getBoard()->isClearHorizontal`.
    - If the horizontal path is clear, set `validMove` to `true`.
    - Return the value of `validMove`.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether the Rook can legally move to the specified square (true if the move is valid, false otherwise).
- **See also**: [`Rook`](rook.h.md#Rook)  (Data Structure)


---
#### Rook::display<!-- {{#callable:Rook::display}} -->
The `display` function outputs the color and type of the Rook piece to the console.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses the `cout` stream to output the Rook's color followed by the letter 'R', representing the Rook piece.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it outputs directly to the console.
- **See also**: [`Rook`](rook.h.md#Rook)  (Data Structure)
