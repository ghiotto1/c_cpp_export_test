The `player.h` file defines a `Player` class for a chess game, including methods for making moves, checking if the player is in check, capturing pieces, and accessing player attributes such as name, color, and score.

# Purpose
The provided code is a C++ header file, `player.h`, which defines the `Player` class for a chess game application. This class encapsulates the attributes and behaviors associated with a chess player, such as their name, color (white or black), the pieces they control, and their king. The class provides a range of functionalities, including making moves, checking if the player is in check, capturing opponent pieces, and calculating the player's score based on captured pieces. The class also includes methods to access the player's name, color, set of pieces, and king, which are essential for managing the state and actions of a player during a chess game.

The `Player` class is designed to be a part of a larger chess game system, as indicated by its dependencies on other classes like `Piece` and `King`. It provides a public API that includes constructors, a destructor, and several member functions that facilitate interaction with the player's state and actions. The use of a set to manage the player's pieces and captured pieces ensures efficient handling of these collections. The class is structured to be integrated into a broader application, likely alongside other components that manage the game board, rules, and interactions between players.
