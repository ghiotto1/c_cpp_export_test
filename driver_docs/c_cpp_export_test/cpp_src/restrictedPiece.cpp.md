The `restrictedPiece.cpp` file defines the `RestrictedPiece` class for a chess project, which extends the `Piece` class to include functionality for tracking whether the piece has moved.

# Purpose
The provided code defines a C++ class [`RestrictedPiece`](#RestrictedPieceRestrictedPiece), which is part of a chess game project, as indicated by the file name `restrictedPiece.cpp` and the comment header. This class inherits from a base class `Piece` and is designed to represent a chess piece with restricted movement capabilities, specifically tracking whether the piece has moved. The class constructor initializes the piece's color and sets a private member `_moved` to `false`, indicating the piece has not yet moved. The [`moveTo`](#RestrictedPiecemoveTo) method attempts to move the piece to a new square, updating `_moved` to `true` only if the move is valid and the piece has not previously moved. The [`hasMoved`](#RestrictedPiecehasMoved) method provides a way to check if the piece has moved. This code provides narrow functionality specific to the chess game logic and is intended to be part of a larger project, likely imported and used by other components of the chess game.

# Data Structures

---
### RestrictedPiece<!-- {{#data_structure:RestrictedPiece}} -->
- **Description**: [See definition](restrictedPiece.h.md#RestrictedPiece)
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`RestrictedPiece::RestrictedPiece`](#RestrictedPieceRestrictedPiece)
    - [`RestrictedPiece::~RestrictedPiece`](#RestrictedPieceRestrictedPiece)
    - [`RestrictedPiece::moveTo`](#RestrictedPiecemoveTo)
    - [`RestrictedPiece::hasMoved`](#RestrictedPiecehasMoved)
- **Inherits From**:
    - `Piece`

**Methods**

---
#### RestrictedPiece::RestrictedPiece<!-- {{#callable:RestrictedPiece::RestrictedPiece}} -->
The `RestrictedPiece` constructor initializes a chess piece with a specified color and sets its moved status to false.
- **Inputs**:
    - `isWhite`: A boolean indicating whether the piece is white (true) or black (false).
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor initializes the base class `Piece` with the `isWhite` parameter to set the color of the piece.
    - It sets the private member variable `_moved` to `false`, indicating that the piece has not been moved yet.
- **Output**: There is no output from the constructor; it initializes the object state.
- **See also**: [`RestrictedPiece`](restrictedPiece.h.md#RestrictedPiece)  (Data Structure)


---
#### RestrictedPiece::\~RestrictedPiece<!-- {{#callable:RestrictedPiece::~RestrictedPiece}} -->
The destructor for the `RestrictedPiece` class performs no specific actions upon object destruction.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The destructor is defined but contains no code, indicating no special cleanup or resource management is required for `RestrictedPiece` objects.
- **Output**: There is no output or return value from the destructor.
- **See also**: [`RestrictedPiece`](restrictedPiece.h.md#RestrictedPiece)  (Data Structure)


---
#### RestrictedPiece::moveTo<!-- {{#callable:RestrictedPiece::moveTo}} -->
The `moveTo` function attempts to move a `RestrictedPiece` to a new square and updates its moved status if the move is valid and the piece hasn't been moved before.
- **Inputs**:
    - `byPlayer`: A reference to the `Player` object attempting to move the piece.
    - `to`: A reference to the `Square` object representing the destination square for the move.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call the `moveTo` method of the base class `Piece` to determine if the move is valid.
    - Check if the move is valid and if the piece has not been moved before.
    - If both conditions are true, set the `_moved` attribute to `true`.
    - Return the result of the base class `moveTo` method indicating if the move was valid.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether the move was successful.
- **See also**: [`RestrictedPiece`](restrictedPiece.h.md#RestrictedPiece)  (Data Structure)


---
#### RestrictedPiece::hasMoved<!-- {{#callable:RestrictedPiece::hasMoved}} -->
The `hasMoved` function checks if a `RestrictedPiece` has been moved from its initial position.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function simply returns the value of the private member variable `_moved`.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether the `RestrictedPiece` has been moved (`true`) or not (`false`).
- **See also**: [`RestrictedPiece`](restrictedPiece.h.md#RestrictedPiece)  (Data Structure)
