# Purpose
This Makefile is designed for building a Chess implementation written in C, facilitating the compilation and linking process using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). It defines several variables, such as `CC` for the compiler and `CFLAGS` for compiler flags, which include warnings and optional debugging information based on the `DEBUG` flag. The file uses pattern rules to compile source files located in the `src` and `src/chesslib` directories into object files, and it creates a static library `libchesslib.a` from these object files, excluding the test main object. It also specifies platform-independent rules for generating the test executable, `tests`, and includes targets for cleaning up build artifacts and running tests. The Makefile ensures that the necessary directories are created and that the build process is streamlined for both development and testing purposes.
