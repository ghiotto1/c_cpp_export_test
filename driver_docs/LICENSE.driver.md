# Purpose
The provided content is a software license known as the MIT License, which is a permissive free software license. It grants users broad rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software, as long as the original copyright notice and permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. This license is designed to maximize freedom for users while limiting liability for the authors, as it explicitly states that the software is provided "as is," without any warranties, and disclaims any liability for damages arising from its use. The inclusion of this license in a software project facilitates open-source collaboration and distribution by clearly defining the terms under which the software can be used and shared.
