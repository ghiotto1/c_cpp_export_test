# Purpose
The provided content is a markdown file that serves as documentation for a C-based chess library called "chesslib." It outlines the build instructions for compiling the library, detailing the use of a makefile compatible with Linux and Windows (via MSYS2), and provides specific steps for setting up the build environment on Windows. Additionally, the document includes a sample C program that demonstrates how to use the library to simulate a random chess game, showcasing the library's functionality by printing moves in UCI format and the final board position in FEN format. The file also outlines future development plans for the library, such as adding support for SAN and PGN formats, improving documentation, and enhancing the API.
