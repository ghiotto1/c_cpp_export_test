# Purpose
The provided content is a markdown file that serves as documentation for a C-based chess library named "chesslib." It outlines the build process for the library, detailing how to compile the source files using a C compiler and providing specific instructions for building on Windows using MSYS2. The document includes a sample C program that demonstrates how to use the library to simulate a random chess game, showcasing the library's functionality by printing UCI moves and the final FEN position. Additionally, the file outlines future development plans for the library, such as adding support for SAN and PGN formats, improving documentation, and enhancing the API. This documentation is essential for developers who wish to understand, build, and extend the chess library.
