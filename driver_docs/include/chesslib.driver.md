## Files
- **[board.h](chesslib/board.h.driver.md)**: The `board.h` file defines the structure and functions for managing a chess board, including initialization, move generation, and state comparison, within the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase.
- **[boardlist.h](chesslib/boardlist.h.driver.md)**: The `boardlist.h` file defines a linked list structure and operations for managing a list of chess boards, including creation, addition, retrieval, undo, and memory deallocation.
- **[chess.h](chesslib/chess.h.driver.md)**: The `chess.h` file defines the structure and functions for managing a chess game, including game initialization, move handling, and draw claims, within the `c_cpp_export_test` codebase.
- **[move.h](chesslib/move.h.driver.md)**: The `move.h` file defines a structure and functions for representing and manipulating chess moves, including conversion to and from UCI notation.
- **[movelist.h](chesslib/movelist.h.driver.md)**: The `movelist.h` file defines data structures and functions for managing a list of chess moves, including creation, addition, retrieval, and conversion to UCI string format.
